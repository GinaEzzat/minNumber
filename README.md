# minNumber
a task that lets us get the minimum value of a list of numbers
first we made an empty list to add the numbers to it
we got 10 numbers from the user and add it to the list by using the add attribute and converting the type of the input to integer
we made a function called minNum to get the minimm number of the list with one parameter which is the list
we initialized a variable named small and assumed that the first number of the list is the minimum number
after that we iterate the list and every time we check whether the current number is less than the minimum , if it is we change the value of the minimum number with the current number of the iteration
then the function returns the minimum number 
finally we assigned the call of the function to a variable then we printed it.
